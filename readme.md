Simple Project I made because I wanted to watch multiple feeds and items for when they come in stock or out of stock. Etc..

Makes use of a couple of my other libraries.

XPATH - which was a practice project I made and isn't finished
CONVERISON - which is another practice project I made what will be used for ensuring numbers fall into the correct ranges you specify.
