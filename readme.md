Simple Project I made because I wanted to watch multiple feeds and items for when they come in stock or out of stock. Etc..

Makes use of my other library.

[XPATH](https://github.com/Its-its/rust-xpath) - which was a practice project I made and isn't finished

## Getting Started
1. Rename config.example.json file in the app directory to config.json
2. Set the telegram [api key](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot).
3. Start the app, talk in the bots' chat. The chat id will be in brackets.
4. Set the chat id in config file, restart app.
5. Website starts on port 8080
